       <span  className="font-semibold text-black block mb-2">  How we collect your information </span> <p> 
We collect information majorly in 2 ways (there may be more inferred/indirect ways) (in furtherance to the major ways mentioned above)
Information we get from your use of our services, and information you provide to us directly.
</p>
 
<p> 
<span  className="font-semibold text-black block "> INFORMATION WE MAY GET FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES </span> is primarily non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers, servers, and services like Google Analytics typically make available, such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and the time of each visit. Other non-identifying information that we may have access to includes how you use the Service (e.g., search queries), your approximate location, and cookies. </p>
We collect this non-personally identifying information in order to better understand how visitors use the services and, where possible, to improve their experience. For instance, we may log the time it takes to run database queries so that we can improve performance. In some cases, we may publicly display information that is not personally identifiable in the aggregate, (e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our services) or may provide the aggregate data to third parties.
When you use the services, we also collect potentially personally identifying information in the form of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, the uniform Resource Locator (URL) accessed, and maybe the unique identification number associated with the account. We DO NOT use that information to identify you, with one
exception: We may discover, by reviewing log files, that a particular account is using the services in a way that is degrading the functionality and experience for all the Services’ users. If this is discovered, we may pierce our general rule to not use this data for identification purposes. Consequently, we may look up personally identifiable information associated with that account in order to contact the account owner. Please note that we handle and disclose this information in the same way we handle other potentially personally identifying information.
